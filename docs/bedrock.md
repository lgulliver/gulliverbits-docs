## How to add a Minecraft Server on Xbox:

Joining on Xbox Requires you to change your connection settings. Doing this will give you a new menu from the server page in your game to add a new server. These settings should not affect online play for other games, but you can reset them at any time should you choose to do so.

Step 1. Open your Xbox settings and select the Network Settings option.
