# Discord

Our server is linked to Discord, so you can chat with other players online on Discord and in-game.

It also allows us to use proximity chat when in game!

To link your Discord account to the server, follow these steps:

Step 1: in-game, enter the command `/discord link`
Step 2: You will be presented with a code. Copy this code.
Step 3: Message the Minecraft Server Bot on Discord with the code.

Once completed, you'll be able to chat with other players in-game from Discord, and vice versa as well as use proximity chat.
