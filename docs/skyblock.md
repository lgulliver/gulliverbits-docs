Skyblock is a survival game that transports you to a small island in mid-air. There is one goal: survive.

You need to try and survive with the minimum resources.

You can with the few given items create a cobblestone generator, which you can then use to expand your island.

By doing the challenges (command `/challenges` or `/c`) you can earn Items, Money, XP and Special permissions. Some of these items you earn are needed to complete the next challenges.

You can play alone or you can invite your friends (`/is invite [playername]`)to build together on your island.

You can set a warp (`/is warp [playername]` to show off what you have done on your island.

You can set your own biome (`/is biome [biomename]`).
